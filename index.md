# Data Science and Decision Making

### Overall

This is a new module on Data Science and Decision Making - we will examine most aspects of modern data science and try to create a fully-fledged end-to-end data science app. The module outline can be found [here](https://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE888&year=17) - but it is still subject to minor changes. The lecture notes and lab scripts for this course will be made available and further developed during the module.  

This is a very hands-on module, where the goal is to give you sufficient breadth and depth to work as an independent data scientist. The course is assessed solely through coursework. 



### Lectures
Lectures take place on **Tuesday 09:00-11:00 at Room 6.345**.

### Labs
Labs are every **Fridays 15:00-18:00, CES Lab 3**. Labs are assessed and they should be completed either in class or later on. 

Please download the lab Virtual Machine from here: [MLVM Virtual Machine](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B_kDfEzMuWD6ZGJFU1VfeEY3TnM&export=download)

### IDEs
You can use whatever IDE you want for the course, however my proposal would be to use PyCharm - which is installed in the lab machines:

*  [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)


### Assessment

The objective of the module and the main assignment is to produce a Data Science app (i.e. make use of data to generate results, make inferences, present the results to third parties) and write down the description of the methods and the results in a scientific paper. Some ideas for possible apps are provided [here](#assignment-suggestions).
